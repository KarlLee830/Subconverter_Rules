# Subconverter Rules

The content of this repo is written primarily for Clash and Surge 4. It has not been tested for use by other clients.

Some of the configuration and rules files I use myself.

Modified from the [ACL4SSR](https://github.com/ACL4SSR/ACL4SSR) repo.

The 2KB & 2XH files are configuration files written for my friend.

The Router file is the configuration file used by my router.

## Main modifications:

1, Removed one grouping per regional server.

2, Netflix and other groupings that require specific servers directly select any server at will.

3, Split Onedrive's client traffic and web traffic into two groupings.

4, Optimize the logic of Steam and other rules.

5, Add rules for ChatGPT and NewBing.

6, for Tiktok and Kwai blocking rules.

After the modification content may change at any time, the README file will not be listed in real time.
